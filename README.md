# __Example: *iis2dulpx_datalog_i3c_entdaa*__


How to use the part API with I3C bus and ENTDAA.

It illustrates it by getting the values of the accelerometer (in mg) and displaying them on a terminal.


## __1. Detailed scenario__

__Initialization phase__: At main program start, the `mx_system_init()` function is called. It initializes the peripherals, nonvolatile memory (such as flash memory, NVM, or external memories), MPU regions (if applicable), the system clock, and the SysTick.

The application executes the following __example steps__:

__Step 1__: Initializes and enables accelerometer feature of IIS2DULPX

__Step 2__: Gets the values of the accelerometer (in mg) and displays them on a terminal

__End of example__: It is an endless example that loops infinitely on step 2

You can follow these execution steps in the terminal logs:
```text
[INFO] Step 1: IIS2DULPX sensor init completed
[INFO] Step 1: Enabling the ACC feature completed
[INFO] Step 2: ACC X=88 Y=-72 Z=1007
```


## __2. Example configuration__


This example demonstrates the following driver:

- Part iis2dulpx.c/.h
- Part iis2dulpx/interfaces/i3c/iis2dulpx_io.c/.h


In this example, the IIS2DULPX component is configured through the I3C IO operations defined under the folder interfaces/i3c.
Once the I3C is initialized, the IIS2DULPX can be initialized too through the call of iis2dulpx_drv_init() API.
After this step, the MEMS sensor will be ready to provide the values of the accelerometer.

## __4. Software setup__

To create a functional project, complete the following steps:
- Select the appropriate IoC2 file based on the combination of NUCLEO and X-NUCLEO boards. For example, use c562re_iks5a1_iis2dulpx_i3c_entdaa.ioc2 for NUCLEO-C562RE and X-NUCLEO-IKS5A1.
- Open the IoC2 file with STM32CubeMX2.
- Select the preferred toolchain and generate the source code.
- Copy the main.c, main.h, example.c, and example.h files into the project folder of the generated code.
- Open the Integrated Development Environment (IDE), add the example.c and example.h files to the project.
- Add the USE_TRACE=1 to the global variables of the project.
- Compile the project.
